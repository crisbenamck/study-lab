    "explanation": "To configure an activation to a Marketing Cloud activation target, you need to choose a segment and select contact points. Choosing a segment allows you to specify which unified individuals you want to activate. Selecting contact points allows you to map the attributes from the segment to the fields in the Marketing Cloud data extension. You do not need to add additional attributes or add the calculated insight in the activation, as these are already part of the segment definition.
